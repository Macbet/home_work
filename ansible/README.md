## Ansible Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Repository - README

### Description

This repository serves as an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) solution using Ansible. It allows for the automated provisioning and management of infrastructure resources and configurations. Ansible, an open-source automation tool, is used to define and execute the desired state of infrastructure components.

### Prerequisites

- Ansible: Ensure that Ansible is installed on the system where you plan to execute the playbooks. You can install Ansible using your system's package manager or other appropriate methods.
- Target Systems: Make sure you have access to the target systems where you want to apply the infrastructure configurations. Ensure proper connectivity and authentication, such as SSH key-based authentication or username/password credentials.

```

- `inventory.yml`: Inventory files specifying the target systems to be managed.
- `playbooks`: Holds the Ansible playbooks responsible for infrastructure provisioning, configuration, and other tasks.
- `roles`: Consists of reusable Ansible roles that encapsulate specific configurations and actions.
- `files`: Contains additional files, such as scripts and templates, required by the playbooks or roles.
- `vars`: Stores variable files used for customizing configurations and behavior.
- `README.md`: The current file, providing an overview of the repository and guidance.
### Before start
Install the required Ansible collections specified in the collections.yml file located in the req directory. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   ansible-galaxy install -r req/collections.yml
   ```

   This command installs the necessary collections to fulfill the requirements of the playbooks and roles.
### Getting Started

To start using this Ansible IaC repository, follow the steps below:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Customize the inventory files (`inventory.yml`)  Define the target systems' connection details, such as IP addresses or hostnames, SSH credentials, and specific groups if necessary.

3. Customize the variable files (`*.yml`) located in the `vars` directory. Modify the variables to match your desired infrastructure configuration.

4. Navigate to the `playbooks` directory and select the appropriate playbook for your intended task. Modify the playbook if needed, specifying the desired roles and configurations.

5. Execute the playbook using the following command:

   ```bash
   ansible-playbook  playbooks/nginx_logs.yml
   ```

   Replace `playbooks/nginx_logs.yml` with the path to the desired playbook. Adjust the inventory file path if necessary.
